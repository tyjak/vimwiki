= Archlinux on vultr =

Use Firefox vor the NoVNC console otherwise webkit navigotor like vimb i use doesn't work.

Don't use vi or you will not be able to quit ! So just do echo things to file...

First difficulties : azerty keyboard !!! Takes me long minutes to find wich key to tap to get the point symbol...
The first symbol to get is the tiret : [altgr]รง
So on my french keyboard with `loadkeys fr-pc` is : [altgr][shift]z 
And to get the slash : [shift]<
And to get ' : $
And to get > : [altgr][shift]<
